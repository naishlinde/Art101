		<p>"Every thought that arises in the mind, in its rising aims to pass out
			of the mind into act; just as every plant, in the moment of germination,
			struggles up to light. Thought is the seed of action; but action is as
			much its second form as thought is its first. It rises in thought, to the
			end that it may be uttered and acted. The more profound the thought, the
			more burdensome. Always in proportion to the depth of its sense does it
			knock importunately at the gates of the soul, to be spoken, to be done.
			What is in, will out. It struggles to the birth. Speech is a great
			pleasure, and action a great pleasure; they cannot be foreborne."
			- Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
