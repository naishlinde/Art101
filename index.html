				<p>"The reason of the thing, without the matter." - Aristotle on the definition Art</p>
				<p>"From the first initiative babble of a child to the despotism of eloquence, from his first pile of toys or chip bridge to the masonry of Minot Rock Lighthouse or the Pacific Railroad, from the tattooing of the Owhyhees to the Vatican Gallery, from the simplest expedient of private prudence to the American Constitution, from its first to its last works, Art is the spirit's voluntary use and combination of things to serve its end." - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
				<p>"Every thought that arises in the mind, in its rising aims to pass out of the mind into act; just as every plant, in the moment of germination, struggles up to light." - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
